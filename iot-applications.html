        <h1>IOT Applications</h1>
        <p>
            <b><h2>Activity 1:</h2></b> Think about IoT applications:
            <ul>
                <li>What is an IoT application?</li>
                <li>Can you think of some Examples?</li>
                <li>What are the main features needed in an IoT application?</li>
            </ul>
            As if you are in the group or as an individual if you are online try to answer these questions by:
            <ul>
                <li>Create lists.</li>
                <li>Create a mind map.</li>
                <li>Create a mini-presentation to explain to others.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><h2>Activity 2:</h2></b> For the scenario of a Smart-Building:
            <ul>
                <li>What does smart mean?</li>
                <li>Think of some smart-building scenarios where this well be beneficial.</li>
                <li>What are the parts needed for it to work?</li>
            </ul>

            <b><h2>Activity 3:</h2></b> Think about the control interface required for building a smart IoT application:
            <ul>
                <li>What are high-level features needed for this interface?</li>
                <li>Think about who will use the interface.Who are the users?</li>
                <li>What are the parts needed to make this work?</li>
