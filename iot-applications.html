        <h1>IOT Applications</h1>
        <h2><b>Activity 1:</b></h2>
        <p>Think about IoT applications: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is an IoT application?</li>
            <li>Can you think of some Examples?</li>
            <li>What are the main features needed in an IoT application?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As if you are in the group or as an individual if you are online try to answer these questions by: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create lists.</li>
            <li>Create a mind map.</li>
            <li>Create a mini-presentation to explain to others.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><b>Activity 2:</b></h2>
        <p>For the scenario of a Smart-Building:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What does smart mean?</li>
            <li>Think of some smart-building scenarios where this well be beneficial.</li>
            <li>What are the parts needed for it to work?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As if you are in the group or as an individual if you are online try to answer these questions by:</p>

        </ul>
        <h2><b>Activity 3:</b></h2>
        <p>Think about the control interface required for building a smart IoT application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are high-level features needed for this interface?</li>
            <li>Think about who will use the interface.Who are the users?</li>
            <li>What are the parts needed to make this work?</li>
        </ul>
